# C# Roadtrip Planner

C# Roadtrip Planner is my project application for my C# course with Code Louisvile in the Summer 2021 semester.

The inspiration for this project came from my passion for travel. My wife and I have been planning a roadtrip through much of Alaska and I thought it would be nice to create an app that could assist with finding places along our routes, as there will be some areas that have no gas or villages for multiple hours at a time.

In it's current form, this app is able to get the approximate location of the user through their current IP address or through user input, depending on the preference of the user. The user is then asked a few questions to determine the best route for the trip and helps find a gas station along the way.

## Instructions:
* ** When the app is first loaded, the user will be asked if they are ready to begin. What happens next depends on user input. If the answer is in the list of expected positive responses (Yes, Yep, Yeah, etc.), then the app will proceed to the next step. If the answer is "quit", then the app will stop running. If the answer is neither positive or "quit", then the user will receive the same prompt to get started.

* ** Once the user gives an expected positive response, they will be prompted to give their Google API key. Google API keys only contain alphanumerics and dashes, so if the submission contains anything other than those characters, the user will be prompted to submit the API key again.

* ** Once the API key has been submitted, the user will be presented with their location based on their IP address. Due to the API that the IP address comes from being imprecise, the location may be off by a few miles. The user will then be prompted to confirm if their IP-based location is correct or not. If the response is an expected positive response, then the app will continue using the IP-based location as the current location of the user. If the response is a negative response, the user will be prompted to type their current location instead of the IP-based location. If the response is not in either the positive or negative lists, then they will be prompted to try again.
